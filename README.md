## INTRODUCTION
The UEFA Champions League (UCL) is an annual club football⚽️ competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

In this project, I did an exploratory data analysis for the Champions League season 2021-2022 ⚽️. The main goal of this work is to visualize interesting statistical data, and found out how players and teams performed throughout the tournament.

## Libraries Used
Pandas as it is designed for versatile data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy serves as the foundation for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions. 
Matplotlib is used for the creation of diverse visualizations, while Seaborn, built on Matplotlib, simplifies statistical data visualization with a high-level interface, making it easy to generate ideas.
## Data Importing and Cleaning
Uploaded the csv datsets and checked for missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in the data and addressed them as needed and ensured that data types are appropriate for analysis.
## Key Findings and Insights
* At first using the "[goals.csv](https://github.com/BRUTALXBONG/EDA-Champions-League-21-22/blob/main/goals.csv)" dataset I found out some of the  basic insights like
    - total goals scored in the tournament - 370
    - total penalties scored in the tournament - 36
    - the clubs that participated(qualified) in the tournament - Real Madrid, Bayern, Ajax, Liverpool, Leipzig,
       Man. City, Paris, Benfica, Man. United, Villarreal,
       Chelsea, Sporting CP, Atlético, Dortmund, Salzburg,
       Club Brugge, Atalanta, LOSC, Inter, Juventus, Sevilla,
       Shakhtar Donetsk, Zenit, Young Boys, Wolfsburg, Sheriff,
       Porto, Dynamo Kyiv, Barcelona, Milan, Malmö, Beşiktaş
    -  most players from which club - Chelsea
    -  total goals scored  by headers - 60
    -  top players who scored max goals in the tournament where I found Benzema, Lewandowski and Haller are the top players with maximum number of goals. Where Karim Benzema scored 15 goals by just playing 12 matches in all total thus making him the top goalscorer of the tournament.
