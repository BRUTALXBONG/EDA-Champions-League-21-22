# EDA-Champions-League-21-22
The UEFA Champions League (UCL) is an annual club football⚽️ competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

In this project, I did an exploratory data analysis for the Champions League season 2021-2022 ⚽️. The main goal of this work is to visualize interesting statistical data, and found out how players and teams performed throughout the tournament.
